# Python Roguelike
A simple roguelike game written in Python 3 and using Pygame.

**Currently in no way polished.**

I am roughly following Michael Coates (The Terrible Programmer)'s [tutorial on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKUel_nHsTQ1yX7tQxR_SQRdcOFyXfNAb).<br>
I'm also utilizing the many amazing resources provided on [RogueBasin](http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Articles).<br>
The ASCII text art was made with [this tool](http://patorjk.com/software/taag/).
